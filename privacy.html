    <p>Welcome to Files Match. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our tool.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> We do not require you to create an account or provide any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) to use our core service. If you contact us via email, we will use your email address solely to respond to your inquiry.</li>
        <li><strong>File Data:</strong> All file processing occurs entirely within your browser on your own computer (client-side). Your files and their contents are <strong>never</strong> uploaded to our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. File Uploads & Processing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Temporary processing:</strong> Files uploaded to perform comparisons are processed in-memory or in temporary storage only for the duration required to complete the comparison. After processing, files and intermediate results are deleted unless you explicitly request otherwise.</li>
        <li><strong>User responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to upload any file and for removing or anonymizing any sensitive data prior to upload.</li>
        <li><strong>Prohibited content:</strong> Do not upload confidential, highly sensitive, or regulated personal data (for example, financial account numbers, medical records, or unredacted PII) unless you have explicit assurances and controls in place.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reasonable measures:</strong> We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect data in our possession against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</li>
        <li><strong>No absolute guarantees:</strong> Despite our efforts, no system can be completely secure. You use the service and upload data at your own risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
